# Crypto
Software for processing historical ciphers and codes

Currently, Crypto provides tools for executing substitution ciphers, decoding messages with a known *or* unknown key, and analyzing text.  As the code exists currently, things are still very experimental.  Methods for other ciphers like transposition ciphers and Vigen√®re ciphers are planned for future releases.
